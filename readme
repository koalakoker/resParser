The purpouse of this project is to implement a command line calculator able to execute the floating point computation with good precision. For this reason the GMP and MPFR library has been used for computations.
The project will be open source with GLP v2 licence and cross platform an so it is implemented with QT.

Features:
* Command line input
* Built-in functions (log, exp, sin, cos, ...)
* Variables
* Specific functions for computation of resistors value (E12, E24) rounding, parallel computation, k = 000, M = 000000
* Store the status (hystory of the commands, variables status) between session
