v.0.1.4
Fixed a bug on Plot window (Set Xmin, Xmax). Implemented Rawdata class and used first working. Issue: - There is no way to update range from point after modification (Delete, Edit) - On load there is no update of the range from point (it is just serialized) Can be fixed with the above
Implemented clead a data point in the DataInspector. Points are stored as pointer. New in the plot, import and load.
Implemented (draft) import RAW data. Fixed a bug on plot (now is case sensitive for function names). The save/load and working with plot is too slow for RAW data big (ex. 200 000 points)
Improved management of history (Get previous, Next, no add if already present)
Clear history implementd (both command line and GUI)
Starting new version 0.1.4. Added the "note of the autor" in the about dialog

v.0.1.3
Implemented clearraw command
Added Draw keyword and fixed E12 and E13
Added del and delete keyword and fixed clear beaviour in ParseClass
Managed not valid range input during plot and automatic range detection when raw data exist.
hfloat specified const some methods.
Architecture changed for Tableinfoelement. User defined function dock visualize if RAW data is present and the range
RAW function partially implemented. (Create from plot and save/load)
Drawwidget option: inpmplemented show grid orizzontal and vertical
Drawwidget option: implemented show x and y labels
Drawwidget automatic computation of marginX based on lenght of the label
Drawwidget option: implemented highlight points feature
Implemented zoom simultaneous using step up or step down of double spin box xmin or ymin
Optimized plot (a list of float point is recalculated just if necessary)
Optimization for plot
Plot data implemented in hfloat (it seems to slow)
Workaround in HFloat conversion toString. "," replaced with "."
Optimized plot data. Implemented data inspector widget.
Cursor implementation has been optimized. Working.
Implemented two cursor in the drawwidget with drag functionality
Implemented first version of drawwidgetbrowse to change range of axis etc...
Fixed label and grid in DrawWidget
Set withe background in the plot
Fixed bug in the computation of function argument. Es. sin(1)*sin(1)
Plot development: - Widget created (just draw) - Plot command implemented (working but too slow)

v.0.1.2
Implemented 6 operator ^ as POW
Variable dock is updated if format is changed
Major modification. Keyword and formatting has been moved into Parser Class
Remove Vars and Function using context menu in Docky
Remove variables and user defined function implemented
Variables and built in function are now soted in a QList

v.0.1.1
Implemented insert variable or functions from dock with double click
Fixed manage of windows when extended for docky (Variable, Functions, ...)
Implemented new dock views for Variables, Built In functions, and User defined functions.

v.0.1.0
Added bynary input
Added input support to Hexadecimal values 64bit
Added Load on init and Save on exti for hystory persistency
Added Save Load of Variables and User defined functions
Save Load Variables
Save/Load partially implemented (Just commands [Input,Result])
Moved append qsInput inside the AddNewCommand
Added CommandClass to store both input string and result (Updating output pane ogn change format)
Added Hexadecimal support (Output format) - Working
Fixed bug on format output
Added support for different output format (Auto, Scientific, Fixed point) Bug on output format not identified Feature shall be upadted
Fixed bug when result is to big or to small and the result is in esponential format.
When name of function is in input the formula is printed.
ans is no more assigned if retVal is nan
Added a "preview" flag to avoid store or modify variable and functions during preview (just after a return it become effective)
First version with user defined functions (working)
Fixed a bug in the computation of built-in function when is non present the ")" Minor aesteic modifications
Added version (0.1.0) Fixed usage output text
Added Readme
Added function window Added about window
Added some built-in function - supported up two arguments
Using QList for built in function arguments
First version with builtin function (sqr,sqrt) working (just 1 arg function supported)
Added tooltip functionality
Extended support to mpfr and fixed many issues that causes heap crash.
Updated UI
.gitIgnore updated
Command si now managed inside command class instead of extarnally
Graphical aspect improoved Fixed bug in resistor assignment
Using gmplib for arbitrari flota precision
Added ans if operator is pressed as first caracter.
Fixed sum difference evaluation
